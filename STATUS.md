We seek to apply for both Available and Reusable badges. We believe our submission qualify for them for the following reasons:
1. Our paper has been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository. 
2. A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.
3. We provide two documents, README.md and INSTALL.md, to demonstrate how to set up, navigate, and use our artifact. As a result, we believe our artifact can be eaily reused for future research projects.
