We seek to apply for both Available and Reusable badges. We believe our submission qualify for them for the following reasons:
1. Our artifact has been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository: https://zenodo.org/record/5911791#.YfNiu3XMJ1M
2. A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided: 10.5281/zenodo.5911791
3. We provide two documents, README.md and INSTALL.md, to demonstrate how to set up, navigate, and use our artifact. As a result, we believe our artifact can be eaily reused for future research projects.
