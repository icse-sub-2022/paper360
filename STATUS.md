We seek to apply for both Available and Reusable badges. We believe our submission qualify for them for the following reasons:
1. Our artifact has been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository.
2. We provide the DOI to this repository in our submission.
3. We provide a docker container image in order to facilitate the reuse of our artifact. We also provide two documents, README.md and INSTALL.md, to demonstrate how to set up, navigate, and use our artifact. As a result, we believe our artifact can be eaily reused for future research projects.
